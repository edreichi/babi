Hi, sorry for my messages kagabi, I was really wasted. 

After pondering on my feelings right now. I think I realize na healing myself is undoubtedly, my priority over everything else. And I won't be able to do that when I'm too fixated sa girl na I love. I just couldn't help myself whenever I think of the possibility na you might be with someone else other than me. Masakit and mabigat po sa chest. Everyday would seem like im holding onto a thin thread hoping na it wouldnt break. I'm too in love to continue this setup saatin. I cannot lie to myself anymore kase miss na miss na kita not just as val, but as my babi. my love. my everything. 

pero sadly, despite everything we exhausted, i guess fate just really is too cruel to let us be together. So I'm letting us go. letting you go. Whatever may come your way, I will support you po, and I will always pray, always love you from afar. If you ever think na life is getting too hard, hit me up ganun, baka namiss ko yung isang day na di ka nasama sa prayer kasi nakatulog sa puyat kaya ganun. 

I will always cherish lahat ng memories and dates natin, mula nung first day sa starbucks, how you made fun of me kase dun ako nag morning routine tas hiya pa ako sayoo >//<, sa foodcourt ng sm santa rosa where first time kita na kiss sa forehead, sa nuvali where we had that free jabi tapos nakipag habulan kela guielle, sa highway pauwi where we walked for so long pang marathon na, sa victory mall where inabot tayo ng past 9 pm nakaupo sa bench kasama yung guard T^T, sa manila where we met sa cubao mrt, sa greenhills where we negotiated with a lot of people just to make a good deal ng ipad ni miah. sa bgc na pinaglakad kita pero you looked so perfect <3 kahit na you think yucky kana sa pawis. and our pinaka last na date na kahit sobrang short twas vv memorable ^^, we had samgyup and ilao ilao. (natikman mo na pistacchio yay!)
nakita mo din kambal ni mama, so i think we can consider that as meet the fam mm mm.

I will miss tita, i will miss her inquiries abt baguio and abt me. I felt like may 2nd mama agad ako. mamimiss ko din si ahya kahit pinagtripan niya ako. mamimiss ko din si achi kahit na di kami ganun masyado nakapag converse. and ultimately, mamimiss kita. every bit of you, how you talk, how you make fun of me, how you get sulky, how you get masungit agad, how you smile, how you made me feel na even sa short moment na yun, I was the happiest man kase I had you.

You made me feel na despite my shattered persona, I was still loved unconditionally. I hoped lang na I was able to show you unconditional love din kahit I was full of shortcomings.

you might think na ironic yung song pero i will always be here to stay, though apart, know that someone loved, someone loves and someone will always love you and that's your babi from baguio.

maybe someday, we can reignite the candles of our emotions towards each other uli. I have so much to tell you pa. Pero next time nlng siguro if ever our fate meets again ^^

Goodbye my love, my cayle, my valerie, my babi.
